There is a zip version of the OS coursework which is the most recent version just incase.

There is an excel document with all the data i accumulated from all experiments in order to create the graphs demonstrated in the pdf document, this was done in google sheets and i am not entirely sure if the graphs will be created in excel.

The pdf contains three experiment analysis sections, with a line at the beginning stating the seeds used.
